				<h2>Our Doctor</h2>
				<p>
					<h3>Meet Dr. Glenwood,</h3> the heart and namesake of Glenwood Veterinarian Clinic. With over two decades of experience in veterinary medicine, Dr. Glenwood has dedicated his career to improving the lives of animals and strengthening the bonds they share with their families.
				</p>
				<p>
Raised on a small farm just outside of town, he learned early on that compassion, patience, and respect for animals are at the core of good care. After earning his Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine, he returned home with a mission: to build a clinic that treats every pet like part of the family.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether he’s treating a sprained paw, comforting a worried owner, or welcoming a family’s first pet, Dr. Glenwood’s approach is always rooted in empathy and understanding. His patients may not be able to speak, but he’s made a career out of listening — to their behavior, their needs, and the people who love them.
				</p>
				<p>
					For Dr. Glenwood, veterinary care isn’t just a job — it’s a lifelong calling rooted in kindness, trust, and community.

						We’ve helped countless animals during our journey, each with their own story and personality. Some were rescues, some lifelong companions, and all left pawprints on our hearts. Here are just a few of our favorite breeds we’ve had the joy of caring for — loyal dogs, curious cats, graceful horses, and colorful birds that make every day at Glenwood Veterinarian Clinic a little brighter.
